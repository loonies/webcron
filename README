webcron
=======

Current release: 0.1.0


Description
-----------

Webcron is a systemd timer that calls remote URLs at defined time
periods, basically acting as a web cron job service. Webcron is simple
and easy to set up.


Installation
------------

Requirements:

 - systemd
 - Bash compatible shell

Installing:

    make install

Run 'make help' for more options.


Documentation
-------------

Webcron requires a configuration file containing a list of URLs to call.
Configuration files are read from `/etc/webcron` directory and are named
by the time period they are run. URLs are listed one per line.

For example, creating a daily cron job that will call `example.com`
requires `/etc/webcron/daily.conf` file with one `https://example.com`
URL entry and, enabled and started `webcron@daily.timer` systemd unit.

Webcron will record the called URL HTTP status into systemd journal.
Webcron doesn't support URL redirects and only HTTP 200 status is
considered successfull.

For easy set up, webcron already comes with empty configuration files
named by systemd calendar event shorthands. Check `systemd.time(7)` for
more information on allowed expressions.
